## Installing Dependencies 
⚠ Make sure you have Python 3 installed. ⚠

```bash
pip install pretty-downloader
```

# Requirements
1. Upload your version of "mods.list" and "modpack.ver". (I suggest uploading them to a github repo because the script requires direct links to them.)
2. The "mods.list" file has to only include the ***Direct*** links to the mods (basically it has to look like this):

![mods.list](https://github.com/Rayrsn/Minecraft-Auto-Mod-Downloader/raw/main/images/mods.list.png?raw=true)

3. The "modpack.ver" file also has to follow the same rule and it has to look like this:

![modpack.ver](https://github.com/Rayrsn/Minecraft-Auto-Mod-Downloader/raw/main/images/modpack.ver.png?raw=true)

* Edit "modlistlink" and "versionLink" to the correct format.


## Setting up and Running the script from source
1. Open the script with a text editor.
2. Edit lines 6 and 7 ("modlistlink", "versionLink") to the correct values. (Read [Requirements](https://github.com/Rayrsn/Minecraft-Auto-Mod-Downloader/blob/main/README.md#requirements).)
3. Change line 11 to your preferred launcher. (You might have to change the "AppData" values if the launcher is ***not*** located in the "AppData/Roaming/.minecraft" directory.)
4. Execute the script by running:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Making an executable (.exe file)
1. Install Pyinstaller `pip install pyinstaller`.
2. Open the script directory in your preferred terminal.
3. Run this line of code:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```
4. Your file will be located in the "dist" directory.
* You can also give it an icon by adding --icon=<Icon_Name>.ico parameter to this line.
* You can replace your minecraft shortcut with this .exe file
